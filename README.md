# SD-Quick-View

SD-Quick-View is a program designed to very quickly look through images generated by Stable Diffusion and see associated metadata.

My other program, PNG-SD-Info-Viewer, was focused more on image curation and other features.  I needed something to quickly browse thumbnails and text.

Simply load in the folder of interest and hover your mouse over the images to see their SD metadata.  Use the slider to adjust thumbnail size.

Left-Click an image to copy the current metadata to clipboard.  Right-click to open the image.  Middle-click to copy the image itself to the clipboard.

That's all there is to it! :)
